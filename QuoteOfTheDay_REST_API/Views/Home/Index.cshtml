<p>
    This repository contains the solution for the **Back End Week 1 Task**, which involves building a REST API for providing users with a daily "Quote of the Day" message. Below are the details of the task:
</p>
<h3>Task Description</h3>

<p>
    Develop an API system that allows users to access a random "Quote of the Day." The API should provide the following functionalities:<br />

    - <b>Get a Random Quote</b>: Users can request a random quote.<br />
    - <b>Add a New Quote</b>: Users can add new quotes to the database<br />
    - <b>Update a Quote</b>: Users can edit and update existing quotes.<br />
    - <b>Delete a Quote</b>: Users can remove a quote from the database.<br />
    - <b>Search by Author (Optional)</b>: Users can search for quotes by the name of the author (optional feature).<br />
</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<p>
    - <b>Programming Language</b>: C#<br />
    - <b>Framework</b>: ASP.NET MVC<br />
